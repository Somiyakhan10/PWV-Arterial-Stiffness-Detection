# PWV Arterial Stiffness Detection

This Python project simulates arterial pressure waves and calculates pulse wave velocity (PWV) to detect arterial stiffness and high-risk arteries.

## Method
- Moens-Korteweg equation for PWV
- Pressure wave simulation along 0.5 m artery
- Threshold-based detection of stiff arteries

## Results
- 3D pressure wave visualization
- Mid-artery pressure comparison
- PWV-based risk detection
